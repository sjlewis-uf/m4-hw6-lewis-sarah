# JavaScript Pizza

## Background

For this assignment, you are being tasked with completing an ordering system for a new business named "Web to Pizza". The ordering system will allow a user to click the "Order Now!" button, then ask the user a series of questions about their pizza order before returning a receipt that includes the order description and cost of the pizza. As a new developer on the team, you are being tasked with completing the pizza-ordering functionality for another developer that was pulled in a different direction.

## Setup

Please create a git repository titled `m4-hw6-lastname-firstname` and clone the repo to your computer. Copy the files from the `unsolved` folder into the root directory of your repository folder.

## Instructions

Your assignment is to finish the pizza-ordering logic contained in the `getPizzaOrder` function within `index.js`. All other aspects of the project are completed for this version, so you will not need to modify or add any other code. Follow the comments contained within `getPizzaOrder` closely as you work. The previous developer on the team is meticulous about commenting, so let her instructions guide you.

Your teammate is also a testing enthusiast and has already written a full set of tests for the `getPizzaOrder` function. If you run the project using [live-server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer), you'll see a button titled "Run Tests". Clicking this will run a test suite on your function in the browser to let you know if you have met all the requirements for completing your assignment. When you are finished, you should also see completed and error-free orders populate the page after a user clicks "Order Now!" and answers the prompts.

## Deployment

Your code must be deployed to GitHub Pages. To deploy a repository to GitHub pages you must

1. Ensure your repository has an `index.html` file in the root directory.
1. Navigate to the `settings` section of the repository
1. Click on `pages` in the left navigation menu
1. Under `source` click the dropdown and select your `master` or `main` branch
1. Click `save`

Your site should be deployed to `<your github username>.github.io/<your repository name>` in 5-10 minutes.

## Submission

Please submit both a link to your repository and a link to the live site. Also please include any comments on stumbling blocks or difficulties encountered while completing the assignment.
